# Norman the Necromancer

## About

Norman the Necromancer is a stoic-themed arcade game where you play as Norman, a misunderstood necromancer who faces endless waves of villagers. Each time Norman is defeated, he calmly returns, learning and enduring through each cycle.

## How It Works

- **Gameplay:**  
  You control Norman, casting spells to defeat incoming villagers and survive each level. After each level, you enter a shop where you can purchase rituals and upgrades to enhance your abilities.

- **Rituals:**  
  Rituals are special upgrades that modify your spells, abilities, or the game world. Some are rare and have unique effects.

- **Souls:**  
  Defeating enemies grants souls, which are used as currency in the shop.

- **Resurrection:**  
  When Norman is defeated, he can resurrect himself and his undead allies, continuing the fight.

- **Shop:**  
  Between levels, you can spend souls on healing, upgrades, or new rituals. Each shop visit features a stoic quote reflecting Norman's philosophy.

- **Victory:**  
  Survive all waves and defeat the final boss to reach the end, where Norman finds peace in acceptance.
